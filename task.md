# Task: Premium Full-Stack To-Do Application

## Objective
Enhance the existing Node.js/Redis backend with a "state-of-the-art" React frontend. The goal is to transform the codebase into a cohesive, production-ready product that features a premium user experience (UX), high performance, and containerized deployment.

## Core Requirements
1.  **Modern UI/UX**: Professional design using modern aesthetics (Glassmorphism, curated color palettes, smooth animations).
2.  **Performance**: Minimal load times using Vite, optimized assets, and efficient caching with TanStack Query.
3.  **Security**: Strict JWT handling, XSS protection on the frontend, and secure communication with the API.
4.  **Robustness**: Complete error handling with user-friendly "Toast" notifications and optimistic UI updates.
5.  **Environment Parity**: Fully containerized environment using Docker Compose for one-command execution.

## Key Features
- **Authentication**: Secure Register/Login flow with session persistence.
- **Task Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capability for To-Do items.
- **Filtering**: Real-time filtering by status (All, Ongoing, Completed).
- **Responsive Design**: Flawless experience across Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
- **Feedback Loops**: Instant visual confirmation for every user action.
